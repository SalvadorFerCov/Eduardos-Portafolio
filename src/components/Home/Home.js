        <h1> Eduardo Peña Junco</h1>
        <p>
          Hola! My name is Eduardo Peña and I'm an Industrial Engineer by career
          but a Gamer by heart. I've worked as a Producer in a videogame studio
          and as a Project Manager/Product Engineer in the software industry.
          What is it that I like about videogames that I would want to dedicate
          my life to them? That is a good question and if I had to answer it, I
          would say the emotions videogames can make you, the player, feel. As a
          Game Designer, I want to create experiences that can make a player
          feel something.
        </p>
