                This project was developed at the Global Game Jam 2020, where I
                participated as a Game Designer and Producer. The theme was
                "Fix".
              </p>
              <p>
                From the first time I thought of the game, I always thought of
                it as a multiplayer experience, because many times, fixing
                anything is easier if you have someone that supports you. Thanks
                to the amazing work of our Lead Eng, we were able to implement a
                4 player co-op experience. Also, since it is
                multiplayer-focused, that means multiple machines can break at
                the same time, leaning on the cooperation factor more.
              </p>
              <p>
                I strived to create a fun cooperative experience that demanded
                some skill of the players but I also added certain randomness to
                it so no game was the same. To have this, I designed various
                mechanics that elevate this concept.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Chaos manager</b>. There is a manager that controls when a machine
                will break. It is based on randomness but takes into account how
                easy or difficult it is to fix the machine.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Harder every time</b>. Each time a machine breaks, the minigame
                becomes more difficult to complete.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hiding the HP bar sets the tension right from the start and adds
                to the frantic communication.
