    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Machines are the main gameplay loop. They crash using a system we
        nicknamed the “Chaos Manager”. This pulls a random number and depending
        on the probability of each machine, they may or may not break down.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a machine is broken down, get ready to enter a minigame to fix it.
        From pressing the A button repeatedly to hitting it a single time for a
        precise action, each machine is different.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a machine continues to be broken down, it will drain the HP of the
        team and if the HP reaches 0, is Game Over. Survive for 5 minutes to
        win!
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Game Design thought process and notes</h2>
    <p>
      This project was developed at the Global Game Jam 2020, where I
      participated as a Game Designer and Producer. The theme was "Fix".
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        From the first time I thought of the game, I always thought of it as a
        multiplayer experience. Thanks to the amazing work of our Lead Eng, we
        were able to implement a 4 player co-op experience.
      </li>
      <li>
        Creating a fun cooperative experience demanded skills of the player but
        I added a certain randomness to it so no game was the same. In order to
        have this, I designed various simple minigames that started easy but
        could become increasingly harder.
      </li>
      <li>
        The machines can break down all at the same time so constant
        communication is key, which makes for a fun couple of sessions. Hiding
        the HP bar sets the tension right from the start and adds to the frantic
        communication.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </>
