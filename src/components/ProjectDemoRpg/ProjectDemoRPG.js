          <b>Timed Commands</b>. If you time your button presses just right when
          attacking an enemy, youâ€™ll do extra damage or even unlock further
          steps of the Combo. Can also be used to defend yourself from incoming
          attacks.

          one you feel more comfortable with. <b>Starter mode</b> will slow down
          the action before each input and show which button(s) to press.
          <b> Master mode</b> will use fewer resources and hit harder but the
          action will move at normal speed and not show any button indications
          on the screen.

                One of the most satisfying feelings is to receive immediate
                feedback for doing anything. I want to give that feeling to the
                players where they can feel good in each fight because they
                managed to land critical hits and evade all attacks. This can
                only be done not by a random stat but by the skill of the
                player. I want to put players in a Flow state when faced with a
                difficult challenge.

                Coming from a long history with RPGs and Fighting games, I
                researched a lot of the systems that have been used in those
                genres and came up with this idea.
              </p>
              <p>
                I took the elements of an RPG and stripped it down to its most
                basic form to test if the core gameplay was good. Then I used
                the combo system found on some RPGs and mixed it with the
                feeling of combos in Fighting games.
